You try to sieze control of your body and set your own course, but your efforts prove futile. Your body continues to run forward with purpose despite there being nothing in sight other than the dasies in this seemingly endless field. Press ENTER to continue...")

You watch as the color also drains from yourself and your surroundings until everything in your dream is black and white. \" You're certainly wondering where you are, aren't you? What's the matter, does it feel too real to be another random dream?\" the mirror image angrily asks of you. He lifts his fork from the plate and forcefully stabs it into the table. The letters he begins carving are rough and jagged, but when he finishes you can clearly make out the words \" D E A T H  R O W \". Press ENTER to continue.")

You knew you had to lucid dream and re-enter that strange world so that you could figure out what happened and the reason for the carving on the table. Press ENTER to complete the game.")
